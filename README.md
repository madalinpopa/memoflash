# Memo Notes Flash

This is a simple REST API that provides an endpoint to retrieve a memo note from usememo.com. 
Since memo is my main note-taking app where I store all my notes from books and things I learn, I thought I could use this along with the Shortcuts app on my phone to get a daily note and revisit what Iâ€™ve learned.
